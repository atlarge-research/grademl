# GradeML

GradeML is a holistic performance analysis tool for machine learning workflows.
Work on GradeML is in early stages.
Currently available in this repository are:

- `src/grade10`: Preliminary work on extending Grade10, our previous work on performance analysis for graph processing systems.
- `src/resource-monitor`: A ligthweight resource monitoring tool for collecting CPU/GPU/memory/disk/network metrics.
- `experiments/tracing-overhead`: Scripts, datasets, and a detailed description of our preliminary experiments quantifying the overhead of tracing in PyTorch and TensorFlow.
