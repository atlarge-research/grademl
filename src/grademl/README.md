# GradeML Query Engine

## Usage Notes

GradeML uses R for estimating resource vector demands.
On Windows, set environment variables to find R executable and libraries: `$RSCRIPT` and `$R_LIBS_USER`.
Run `.libPaths()` in an R console to find the user's library directory.

Install required R packages:
- bvls
